    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Software developer for 20 years, I am a curious person, eager to learn new
      things. Having done a lot of Java development, I have also created and publish
      iOS applications and PHP backend. I am highly proficient in heavy traffic API
      optimisation and everything related to backend development. I have a deep
      knowledge of public cloud solutions like AWS and GCP but also docker solutions
      with Rancher. At the moment, I am looking to join a team to invest myself in a
      product with big technical challenges.

experiences:
    - role: Software Architect
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: Orange, Lannion
        Create microservice architecture for different enterprise services.
        Usually we use spring boot for the rest service coupled with rabbitMQ for the asynchronous part.
        I also used golang to perform some rest service. I also work a lot on deployment part
        on the differents PAAS services of the group. Even though we mainly use Openshift,
        I have also worked with cloud foundry and Google Cloud. I also participated in the ONAP open source
        project which allows, among other things, a complete management of the life cycle of 5G networks.
          - Java, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, Openshift, Golang
    - role: Software Architect
      time: 2016 - 2019
      company: Apizee, Lannion
      details: |
        I managed the migration of a PHP framework and removed symfony 2 to use Laravel 5.
        We also changed the hosting solution in order to use a private cloud base on VMWare
        solution in good practice in terms of security (VLAN, VPN, firewall…). As a Scrum master,
        I work with our Product manager to organise all sprint tasks. For 1 year I specifically
        worked on simplifying the deployment of the Apizee platform. Some clients refused to use
        the SAAS platform to isolate their data. To better protect our client data we deployed
        the Apizee services on their servers. To increase efficiency we used Rancher UI to orchestrate
        Docker images. All of our services deploy within 10 minutes using this system.
          - PHP, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, socketIO, Laravel 5, Docker, Rancher, Gitlab
    - role: CTO
      time: 2013 - 2016
      company: Sushee, Lannion
      details: |
        I created a video game company with my friend and associates at Sushee. At the beginning
        Sushee developed small web games in HTML5 for brands like Hollywood or Oasis. Within 2 years
        we hired 7 people and with this team we worked on our game which was called Goetia. I managed
        the developers team and developed the link with steam API. The indie game team of Square Enix
        showed interest in our game and decided to become our publisher. Goetia can be downloaded
        on Steam and GOG.com.
          - PHP, PostgreSQL, Laravel 5, Docker, HTML5, Steam
    - role: CEO
      time: 2012 - 2016
      company: Apptom, Lannion
      details: |
        I assisted companies to migrate infrastructure on public cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services
        or Google App Engine. I developed scalable chat service in PHP that can add servers on runtime
        if traffic increases with AWS Beanstalk solution. I also created a service on the first version
        of PHP Google App Engine to manage a “Question / Answer” web service.
          - PHP, AWS, Codeigniter
    - role: Software Developer
      time: 2012 - 2016
      company: Orange, Lannion
      details: |
        I participated in developing a JEE project that managed alerts for emergency services. We used
        EJB (session and entity) for backend and struts framework for frontend. To accelerate the development,
        we created an MDA solution (Model Driven Architecture). Based on the UML model we generated code for
        all EJB structure. We created two patents for this project (FR2890204A1, EP1630761A1)

        With the same MDA framework we created a machine to machine middleware. I worked on the architecture.
        I specifically developed all asynchrone message management and all connectors to other Orange services.
        We also started to use SCRUM at this period.

        After this I joined the client relation team. I learned iOS development and published the first version
        of “Orange and Me” for Switzerland. This application informs clients about their consumption.
